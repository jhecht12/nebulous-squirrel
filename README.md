# Password Manager
Password manager and generator for multiple users in Java. Program uses Java I/O to read and write files containing names of users and user passwords. Tree Maps are used to store passwords with account being used as keys. "userdata" file will be generated on first run and contains names of users and master password for each. Upon creation of new users, file with name of user is created that stores accounts and passwords separated by new lines. While program is running, continuously prompts user to either add new passwords, retrieve passwords, or end program. When adding new passwords, users can choose to either enter their own password or have one generated for them with length and use of special characters specified by the user. Generated passwords are created using a random number generator that selects characters from a list of valid characters. Any new passwords are written to the user file to be accessed on later runs of the program. When retrieving a specific password, users are prompted for which account they need the password for and if the account is a key in the passwords map, the corresponding password is printed out.
